Creating a blockchain from scratch to learn how one works.

## Each block needs to have:
* An index;
* A timestamp;
* A list of transactions with their sender, recipient, and the amount.
* Beyond that, a block needs to have its proof of work and the previous hash.

## Definitions:
- Proof of work algorithm = How new blocks are created or mined.
- Proof of work goal = Discover a number that solves a problem.
- The number must be very difficult to find but very easy to verify.
