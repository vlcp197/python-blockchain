Creating a blockchain from scratch to learn how one works.

## Each block needs to have:
* An index;
* A timestamp;
* A list of transactions with their sender, recipient, and the amount.
* Beyond that, a block needs to have its proof of work and the previous hash.

## Definitions:
- Proof of work algorithm = How new blocks are created or mined.
- Proof of work goal = Discover a number that solves a problem.
- The number must be very difficult to find but very easy to verify.

## Consensus Algorithm:
- The longest valid chain is Authoritative. In other words, the longest chain is the official and correct version of the blockchain, since it's the chain that is accepted by the majority of nodes in the network
